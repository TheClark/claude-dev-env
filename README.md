[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Windows%20(WSL2)-blue.svg)](https://github.com/)

## üéØ Purpose

This Docker environment solves a common problem: **running Claude Code on Windows with large codebases**. It provides:

- ‚úÖ **Claude Code pre-installed** - Starts automatically when you enter the container
- ‚úÖ **Windows path handling** - Seamlessly converts Windows paths to Linux paths
- ‚úÖ **Large codebase support** - Mount any size project without file limitations
- ‚úÖ **All development tools included** - No need to install dependencies on Windows
- ‚úÖ **Persistent environment** - Your settings and work persist between sessions

## üéØ Quick Start for Windows Users

```powershell
# 1. Clone this repo into your project (or anywhere)
git clone https://github.com/TheClark/claude-dev-env.git claude-setup
cd claude-setup

# 2. Copy the example env file and edit it
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your project path and credentials

# 3. Run the start script
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-claude.ps1

# 3. Claude Code starts automatically!
```

### üéâ Now What? Getting Started with Claude Code

Once Claude Code starts, you're ready to work with your codebase! Here's how to get started:

```bash
# Your entire project is mounted at /workspace
cd /workspace

# See your project files
ls -la

# Start working with Claude
# Example: "Help me understand this codebase"
# Example: "Find all API endpoints in this project"
# Example: "Write unit tests for the user service"
```

**Quick tips:**
- üìÅ Your Windows project (e.g., `C:\MyProject`) is available at `/workspace` in the container
- üíæ All changes are saved directly to your Windows filesystem in real-time
- üîÑ Exit anytime with `exit` or Ctrl+D - your work persists
- üöÄ Restart instantly with the same start script - no rebuild needed

### Alternative: Using the Setup Wizard

If you prefer a guided setup, use the init script:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\init.ps1
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Check Docker Desktop is running
2. ‚úÖ Ask where your code is located (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\MyProject`)
3. ‚úÖ Set up your GitHub and Anthropic credentials
4. ‚úÖ Build the Docker image (~3-5 minutes first time)
5. ‚úÖ Launch Claude Code with your project mounted

## üîß Why Use This?

### The Problem
- Claude Code on Windows can have issues with large codebases
- Installing all development dependencies on Windows is complex
- Path handling between Windows and Linux tools is problematic
- Environment inconsistencies between team members

### The Solution
- Run Claude Code in a Linux container with your Windows files mounted
- All tools pre-installed: Python, Node.js, Java, Git, and more
- Automatic path conversion (e.g., `C:\MyProject` ‚Üí `/workspace`)
- Consistent environment that works the same for everyone

## üí° Typical Use Cases

### Working with Large Codebases
```powershell
# Your large project at C:\Work\BigProject
PROJECT_PATH=C:\Work\BigProject

# Claude Code can now access all files without Windows limitations
# Work with millions of files, deep directory structures, long paths
```

### Multiple Language Projects
```powershell
# Project with Python backend, React frontend, Java services
# All tools are pre-installed - no setup needed!
```

### Team Collaboration
```powershell
# Everyone uses the same environment
# No more "works on my machine" issues
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Script Error
```powershell
# If you see "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-claude.ps1

# Or permanently allow scripts
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Docker Not Running
```powershell
# Error: "Docker is not running"
# Solution: Start Docker Desktop from Windows Start Menu
# Wait for Docker to fully start (system tray icon turns green)
```

### Path Issues
```powershell
# If PROJECT_PATH not found, check:
# 1. Path exists: Test-Path "C:\YourPath"
# 2. No typos in path
# 3. Use full absolute path, not relative
```

### Claude Code Not Starting
```powershell
# Force rebuild if Claude Code is missing
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-claude.ps1 -Rebuild

# Check if installed
docker exec claude-dev which claude

# Or use shell mode to debug
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-claude.ps1 -Shell
```

### Large Codebase Performance
```ini
# In .env file, increase resources:
CPU_LIMIT=8
MEMORY_LIMIT=16G
```
